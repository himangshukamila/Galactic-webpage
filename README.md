🌌 Overview
Galactic Explorer is an immersive space exploration platform built with a cutting-edge tech stack. Unlike traditional space apps, this project features a dynamic orbital engine and high-fidelity planetary rendering using real-world physics data and transparent textures.

🛠 Tech Stack & Tools
Core Engine: React 19 ⚛️ — Utilizing the latest concurrent rendering features for zero-lag UI transitions.

Styling: Tailwind CSS v4 🎨 — Leveraging the new @theme engine, bg-linear gradients, and CSS-variable-first architecture.

Animation: Framer Motion 🎬 — Powering the complex orbital paths, 3D hover states, and smooth entrance sequences.

Performance: Vite 6 ⚡ — Ensuring lightning-fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR) and optimized build chunks.

Data: Axios 🛰️ — Fetching real-time planetary metrics and NASA's daily celestial captures.

🚀 Key Features
🛰️ Interactive Solar System: A custom-built orbit view where planets respond to hover and click events with 3D transformations.

🪐 High-Fidelity Textures: Support for transparent PNGs with custom drop-shadow filters to simulate planetary atmospheres.

📱 Responsive Nebula UI: A glassmorphic interface that adapts perfectly from ultra-wide monitors to mobile devices.

📊 Live Planetary Data: Real-time information on gravity, density, and temperature for every major celestial body.

✨ Particle Stars Background: A lightweight, CSS-animated starfield that creates a sense of depth and movement.
